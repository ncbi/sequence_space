Note that this code was built to make predictions of NusG sequences only.  Attempting to use it on other protein sequences will yield erronous results.  
  
This code cannot run without the following dependencies:

hmmer-2.3.2: http://hmmer.org/download.html
mview-1.67: https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-mview/files/bio-mview/mview-1.67/
blast 2.2.26: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/legacy.NOTSUPPORTED/
jnet_src_v.2.3.1: https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/about.shtml
python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

python3 packages required to run code:
matplotlib
pandas numpy
biopython
networkx
scikit-learn

For the code to run properly:  
-> $WDIR must be defined in jpred_pipeline_updated.sh as the directory containing all scripts and data
-> The two data directories (CTDs_40_jpred.tgz CTDs_40_uniprot90.tgz) must be unpacked within $WDIR.  They contain all results for the 10 experimentally  
   validated variants described in the paper
-> hmmer must be compiled, and the executables must be installed in a hmmer-2.3.2/src directory $WDIR.  
   Alternatively, hmmer can be installed anywhere, and its location can be updated in jpred_pipeline_updated.sh.  
-> mview must be compiled and its executable must be installed within $WDIR
-> jnet (the JPred algorithm) must be compiled and saved in jnet_src_v.2.3.1 within $WDIR  
-> python3 and all specified packages must be installed  

To analyze the JPred results within the 2 data directories, collate_preds_final.py can be run separately on the data as follows:

ls -d $PWD/CTDs_40_jpred/* > outfiles.txt  
./collate_preds_final.py outfiles.txt results  

Once all of these conditions have been met, the entire pipeline can be run with ./run_preds.sh  
***NOTE THAT USING ./run_preds.sh INCORRECTLY WILL OVERWRITE THE DATA.  IT IS RECOMMENDED TO MAKE BACK-UP FILES OF THE DATA FOR THIS REASON***
To learn about scripts and their functions, look at jpred_pipeline_updated.sh.  It runs JPred on PSI-BLAST-generated data.  
collate_preds_final.py analyzes all JPred predictions, determines whether a sequence switches folds, and outputs all results to a user-specified outfile.  
Usage: collate_preds_final.py <infile> <name of output csv>
